/**
* The <code>ServiceRegistry</code> is a static class and does not need to be constructed.
*
* The <code>ServiceRegistry</code> is used to allow a given application access to application
* services.
*
* <p>Services are typically registered or requested using an alias name, but older applications
* may still register and request using interfaces, which is also still supported. Applications
* that use aliases don't normally need to manually register services as these are created lazily
* upon first request, but will still need to manually register services that can't be created
* using a zero-arg constructor.</p>
*
* <p>The <code>ServiceRegistry</code> is initialized as follows:</p>
*
* <ol>
*	<li>The application invokes {@link br.ServiceRegistry.initializeServices} which
*		causes all delayed readiness services to be created.</li>
*	<li>Once {@link br.ServiceRegistry.initializeServices} has finished (once one of the
*		call-backs fire), the application should then register any services that can't be created
*		lazily using zero-arg constructors.</li>
*	<li>The application can now start doing it's proper work.</li>
* </ol>
*
* <p>Because blades aren't allowed to depend directly on classes in other blades, interface
* definitions are instead created for particular pieces of functionality, and blades can choose
* to register themselves as being providers of that functionality. The
* <code>ServiceRegistry</code> and the {@link br.EventHub} are both useful in this
* regard:
*
* <ul>
*	<li>Many-To-One dependencies are resolved by having a single service instance available via
*		the <code>ServiceRegistry</code>.</li>
*	<li>Many-To-Many dependencies are resolved by having zero or more classes register with the
*		{@link br.EventHub}.</li>
* </ul>
